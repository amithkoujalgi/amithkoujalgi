# About

Hey ðŸ‘‹! I'm a software engineer who's been building cool [software products](/docs/category/projects) for over a decade.
I love creating impactful software products and solutions.
I have extensive experience mentoring newer developers and leading teams to create innovative solutions.
Tech is my jam - I'm always tinkering with new tools and sharing what I build through [open-source projects](/docs/category/open-source-projects). 
Beyond coding, I'm passionate about photography and love capturing beautiful moments. Check out some of my work in my [photography portfolio](/docs/beyond-tech/photography).
