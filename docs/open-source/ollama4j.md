Authored an open-source Java library to interact with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) - a tool to run large language models (LLMs) locally on a
computer.

Sometime back, I created a small wrapper called Ollama4j to interact with the Ollama server over the REST API in Java as a side project and made the repository public on GitHub. Over time, the project gained traction, with many fellow Java developers contributing, and it now boasts over 300 stars! üòç

We‚Äôve consistently introduced new features, and when we added the tool-calling capability, the library became incredibly powerful, opening up so many possibilities. With this addition, we could automate numerous tasks using natural language!
