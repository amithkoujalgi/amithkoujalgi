In today's digital landscape, secure and seamless user authentication across multiple applications is paramount. To address this need, I developed the "Keycloak SAML 2.0 SSO Demo" project, which showcases the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO) using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) with Keycloak.‚Äã

Motivation

Managing multiple sets of credentials for different applications can be cumbersome for users and challenging for administrators. Implementing SSO enhances user experience by allowing access to multiple applications with a single set of credentials, thereby reducing password fatigue and improving security. SAML is a widely adopted protocol for SSO, and Keycloak is a robust open-source identity and access management solution that supports SAML. This project aims to demonstrate how to integrate SAML-based SSO using Keycloak.‚Äã

Project Overview

The project sets up a SAML authentication system using Keycloak by configuring two Keycloak instances:‚Äã

Identity Provider (IdP): Authenticates users and provides identity information.‚Äã

Service Provider (SP): Relies on the IdP for user authentication.‚Äã

Additionally, a demo application acts as a client secured by the Keycloak SP, ensuring that all authentication workflows are handled exclusively through SAML. This setup demonstrates seamless integration and secure authentication flows between the IdP, SP, and the demo application.‚Äã

SAML-Based SSO Flows Covered

The demo encompasses two types of SAML-based SSO flows:

IdP Initiated Flow: The user logs in through the IdP and then accesses the service provider without re-authentication.‚Äã

Service Provider Initiated Flow: The user attempts to access the service provider, which redirects them to the IdP for authentication.‚Äã

Implementation Steps

Set Up Keycloak Instances: Deploy two Keycloak instances using Docker‚Äîone as the IdP and the other as the SP.‚Äã

Configure IdP and SP: Set up the IdP with user credentials and configure the SP to communicate with the IdP using SAML protocol.‚Äã

Secure Demo Application: Integrate the demo application with the Keycloak SP to enforce SAML-based authentication.‚Äã

Demonstrate SSO Flows: Test both IdP and SP initiated flows to ensure seamless user authentication across the systems.‚Äã

Conclusion

This project illustrates the practical implementation of SAML-based SSO using Keycloak, providing a foundation for integrating secure and efficient authentication mechanisms into applications. By following the steps outlined in the repository, organizations can enhance their security posture while offering a streamlined user experience.‚Äã
