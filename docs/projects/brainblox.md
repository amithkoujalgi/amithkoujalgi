# BrainBlox

Brainblox (formerly known as Inblox), is an intelligent email application powered by advanced deep learning technology.
This app prioritizes emails based on their urgency and importance, ensuring that users can address critical messages
first.
Additionally, it generates MailBytes, which are concise summaries of email content, saving users valuable time by
eliminating the need to read through irrelevant information. One of the notable features of Brainblox is its
groundbreaking
Advanced Find functionality, similar to Google Mail, enabling users to easily locate specific emails. It also has a
Teach the
Brain capability, allowing users to train the underlying deep-learning systems to identify and take action on similar
email
content. Along with these, it provided natural language processing capabilities to answer user's questions such as "Who
haven't I contacted lately?" or "What are the important and urgent emails of this week?" or even "When is my credit card
bill payment due?"
