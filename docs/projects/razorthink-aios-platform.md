# Razorthink aiOS

Razorthink aiOS is an enterprise-grade SaaS product designed for data scientists, engineers, and analysts to visually
create data transformation recipes, deep learning models, and end-to-end pipelines. It facilitates the ingestion of data
from enterprise environments to generate intelligence (AI pipelines) that supports downstream systems in making
critical, data-driven business decisions.

Razorthink AI Operating System, RZT aiOS, consolidates the best ideas and work you produce, fosters team collaboration,
and supports the swift and effective delivery of AI solutions.

As the first operating system for AI, RZT aiOS frees data scientists and engineers from repetitive coding tasks,
allowing them to focus on complex business challenges. By unifying AI development and teams across the organization, RZT
aiOS simplifies the process of rapidly creating, tuning, and deploying optimal solutions within budget and on schedule.

### What is RZT aiOS?

RZT aiOS is an AI operating system designed to streamline the development and deployment of artificial
intelligence solutions. It provides pre-tested code blocks that can be used to build AI applications. This saves data
scientists and engineers time by eliminating the need to write repetitive code from scratch.Equipped with machine
learning (ML), AutoML, and Intelligent Deep Learning (DL) capabilities, it supports existing AI tools and models to
create a unified environment for AI asset management. It fosters collaboration and efficiency by seamlessly integrating
with popular AI technologies like Jupyter and Spark. Hosted securely on Azure as a Software as a Service (SaaS)
offering, the operating OS ensures data privacy and compliance.
