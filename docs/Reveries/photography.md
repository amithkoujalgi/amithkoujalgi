While hanging out on my balcony, I spotted
an [Indian white-eye (Zosterops palpebrosus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_white-eye) perched upside down on a
delicate
twig. It really stood out against the lush backdrop of green leaves. The treeâ€™s leaves framed the bird perfectly, and
the whole scene had this gorgeous depth of field, with that dreamy bokeh effect in the background.
